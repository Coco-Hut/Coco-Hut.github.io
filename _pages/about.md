<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D candidate in the Data and Knowledge Research Group ([DKR](https://unswdb.github.io/index.html)), School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales (UNSW). I am now under the joint supervision of Dr. [Xiaoyang Wang](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-xiaoyang-wang) and Prof. [Xuemin Lin](https://itf.sjtu.edu.cn/enshow-275-42.html). My research interest includes Graph Mining, Hypergraph Learning, and Data-centric AI. 

Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from Tongji University, China, in 2023. I was a research intern at Fintech Lab in Tongji University, supervised by Prof. [Dawei Cheng](http://cs1.tongji.edu.cn/~dawei/).
